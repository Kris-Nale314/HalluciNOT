# HalluciNOT

## Document-Grounded Verification for Large Language Models

HalluciNOT is a modular toolkit for detecting, measuring, and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs when working with document-based content. It leverages rich document structure and metadata to efficiently verify LLM-generated content against source materials, ensuring factual consistency and appropriate uncertainty communication.

## Why HalluciNOT?

LLMs are powerful but prone to hallucinations - generating content that seems plausible but is factually incorrect or unsupported by source documents. In document-grounded applications like RAG systems, these hallucinations undermine trust and reliability.

HalluciNOT addresses this challenge by:

- **Tracing claims back to source**: Mapping LLM assertions to specific document locations
- **Measuring factual alignment**: Quantifying how well claims match their source material
- **Detecting unsupported content**: Identifying claims without sufficient grounding
- **Managing hallucinations**: Providing strategies to handle detected inaccuracies

## Core Features

### 🔍 Claim Detection and Source Mapping
- Extract discrete factual assertions from LLM outputs
- Map claims back to specific document chunks using metadata
- Calculate semantic alignment between claims and sources
- Identify unsupported or misaligned claims

### 📊 Confidence Scoring System
- Quantify alignment between claims and source material
- Provide multi-dimensional confidence metrics for different claim types
- Generate consolidated trustworthiness assessments for responses
- Calibrate confidence scores based on evidence strength

### 🛠️ Hallucination Management
- Select appropriate interventions for detected inaccuracies
- Generate corrections grounded in source material
- Implement standardized uncertainty communication patterns
- Maintain conversation flow while addressing factual issues

### 📈 Visualization and Reporting
- Highlight confidence levels within responses
- Create clear source attributions and citations
- Generate detailed verification reports
- Monitor hallucination patterns over time

## Integration with ByteMeSumAI

HalluciNOT is designed to work seamlessly with [ByteMeSumAI](https://github.com/username/ByteMeSumAI), leveraging its document processing pipeline:

1. ByteMeSumAI handles document ingestion, processing, and metadata enrichment
2. HalluciNOT defines additional metadata requirements for verification purposes
3. Together they create a robust pipeline for accurate, verifiable document-based AI interactions

## ⚠️ Development Status

**IMPORTANT**: HalluciNOT is currently in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
